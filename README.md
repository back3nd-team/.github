## Development Team

Welcome to the development journey of **back3nd**, a project that has the potential to change the way developers build and manage backends. This project is **open-source** and **free**, meaning the impact we make here could reach developers and teams worldwide.

By the end of these five sprints, we will have built a flexible backend framework that dynamically generates APIs, manages user roles and permissions, and offers an intuitive **Data Studio** for managing everythingâ€”all powered by **Bun**, **Prisma**, and **Nuxt 4**. 

Imagine the possibilities: a product that other developers can extend and contribute to, fostering a growing community around **back3nd**. Weâ€™re building something that we can be proud of and that the world can use freely.

Letâ€™s bring our passion and dedication to each sprint, knowing that every task completed brings us closer to delivering an innovative and game-changing project to the open-source community. Together, we can achieve something truly exceptional!
